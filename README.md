# 2_5Axis-foam-cutter-slicer

## What the project does
The project provides a slicer that inputs STL files (3D models) then finds various outlines that can be cut out to create the shape using a foam cutter. 
The=is path is then converted into G-Code which is sent to a arduino running GRBL. Once cutting is complete using a hot wire the model is created in foam.

The working project is displayed on my website tiaanspies.com/projects.
